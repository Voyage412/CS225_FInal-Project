# Team Contract

## Communication
1. **Team Meeting

We take meeting by using zoom or in person once a week. And each meeting at least one hour. One person will take notes 


2. **Assistance** 

We use wechet and email to connect each other. Everyone should respond to message in 2 hours.

3. **Respect** 

We will communicate with each other to make sure that everyone's opinions will be respected.

## Collaboration

4. **Work Distribution** 

We will assign tasks each week. If we have unexpected complications or unforeseen work, we will have additional meetings to discuss and make sure we have solutions. We will give different tasks to person who is good at that part. The overall work will be equal.

5. **Time Commitment** 

Each person will work a minimum of three to five hours per week. The exact amount of time will be allocated based on the amount of student learning tasks for that week. If you are unable to complete a task, you will need to notify your team members in advance, and any tasks that cannot be completed will be reassigned. In the following week, students who do not complete their assignments will be given additional work.

6. **Conflict Resolution** 

If there is a disagreement between members, we will have a discussion so that everyone can understand and agree with the final decision which we make since we respect everyoneâ€™s opinions. If one or more members have not accomplished their tasks, we will first ask him(her) or them the reason. If the reason is reasonable, such as some emergency or personal issues, we may consider how to help him(her) or them out and keep track of the project. Every week we will make a plan to keep track of the project. If someone is habitually late,  we will push him(her) and always remind him(her) of the deadline and our schedule to prevent we miss the deadline of the schedule and the project. We will have a discussion to resolve our possible conflict and try to solve it out. But if the situation escalates, the person who is least affected by the ground rule gets to decide whether they should intervene themselves or approach to course staff.
