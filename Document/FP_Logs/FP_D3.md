# Development Log (Date: 11/14/22 -- 11/18/22)

## Weekly Goals

During this week, we extract the information from dataset files and complete the construction of the graph Then, we find the shortest distance between two airports using the Dijkstra algorithm.

## Specific Tasks Completed (and by who)

1. Extracting information from dataset files (.dat) (Xiaoyang Tian)
2. Build nodes and edges to compose graph with data set information (Yanxin Jiang)
3. Find the most convenient route between the two airports using the Dijkstra algorithm. (Jin Fan)
4. Test the functionality and implementation of each function (Gezhi Zou)

## Problems Encountered 

When we finish writing a program for the same document at the same time modification may cause conflicts. It is difficult to know if the program is running correctly when testing with a large data set.

## Plans for next week

Use the page rank algorithm to find the most important airports in this dataset and complete the BFS traversal

## Optional: Questions for mentor
