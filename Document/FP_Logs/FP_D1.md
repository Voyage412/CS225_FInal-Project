# Development Log (Date: 22/10/31 -- 22/11/04)

## Weekly Goals

Complete the prep work, including the completion of the group division of labor, the determination of the meeting time, etc.

## Specific Tasks Completed (and by who)

Xiaoyang Tian: Data collection.
Yanxin Jiang:plan to make structure of the algorithm.
Gezhi Zou: Built github.
Jin Fan: Wrote the meeting notes.

## Problems Encountered 
During our discussion, we have encountered several issues. Firstly, the goal of the our final project. We have discussed the topic and goal for our final project to come up with the fittest topic as our final project, which is to find any shortest path algorithm to find preferred routes and make a graphical output on projected onto a world map. Secondly, the algorithms we are trying to use. To figure it out, we tried to look through the dataset to see what kind of algorithm may be helpful to make these inputs into graph and what kind of algorithm can be more useful to search shorted parts and make graphical output. Finally, we decided to use BFS, Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm for the project. And we consider that if there is any issue using these algorithms to work on the project, we will discuss about the algorithm again to find a better way.

## Plans for next week

Design and write openflight algorithms

## Optional: Questions for mentor
