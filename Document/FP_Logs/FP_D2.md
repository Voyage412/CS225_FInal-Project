# Development Log (Date: 11/04/22 -- 11/11/22)

## Weekly Goals

  Design openflight algorithms and write all the preliminary code except the algorithm(eg:.h file)

## Specific Tasks Completed (and by who)

  1.Rewrite proposal (by Xiaoyang Tian,Yanxin Jiang,Gezhi Zou,Jin Fan)
  2.Determine the algorithm to use for the final project: BFS, Dijkstra’s Algorithm and Page Rank Algorithm. (by Xiaoyang Tian, Yanxin Jiang, Gezhi Zou, Jin Fan)
  3.Write airport class code in github (Gezhi Zou)
  4.Write the meeting note (Xiaoyang Tian)

## Problems Encountered 

  We received a zero after our first proposal submission, which made us panic. But this week we improved our proposal and clarified our goals and directions. We wanted to know how the new proposal would look and what we could do to improve it.

## Plans for next week

  Write BFS and Dijkstra’s Algorithm which can traversal graph data and find the convenient path between the given departure airport and the destination airport.

## Optional: Questions for mentor
